# **Automatic Text Summarization Tool.**
This tool helps the user to summarize a large text to the minimal number of sentences using an algorithm that we have developed
during a team project.<br />
The Algorithm works on the extraction of the most important sentences and removing insignificant transition
phrases, unnecessary clauses and excessive examples.<br />
The project was coded in C language.<br />
**See the algorithm steps [here](https://github.com/YahyaAlaaMassoud/Automatic-Summarization/blob/master/Summarization%20Algorithm.pdf).**
